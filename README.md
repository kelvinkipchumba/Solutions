#Fibonacci Sequence Generator - Java Program

##Description:
This repository contains a Java program that generates a Fibonacci sequence based on user input. The program prompts the user for an input number and then prints the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. It includes validation for positive integer inputs, graceful error handling, and modular code structure. The program has been optimized to efficiently generate the Fibonacci sequence.

##Features:

Validates user input to ensure it is a positive integer
Generates the Fibonacci sequence starting with 0 and 1
Handles input errors gracefully and displays appropriate error messages
Well-structured, modular, and readable code
Optimized implementation for efficient generation of the Fibonacci sequence

##Usage:

Run the program and provide a positive integer as input when prompted.
The program will generate and display the Fibonacci sequence up to the input number.

#Largest Difference Finder - Java Function

##Description:
This repository includes a Java function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the list. The function handles input lists of any size, including cases with duplicate numbers. It returns 0 if the list has less than two elements. The code is well-structured, modular, and readable, and it accounts for potential errors or edge cases.

##Features:

Calculates the largest difference between any two numbers in the input list
Handles input lists of any size
Handles cases with duplicate numbers
Returns 0 if the list has less than two elements
Well-structured, modular, and readable code
Efficient time complexity for solving the problem

##Usage:

Call the function and provide a list of integers as input.
The function will return the largest difference between any two numbers in the list.
